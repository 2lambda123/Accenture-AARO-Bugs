### explib3 
Gutted out outdated components of explib2 and added a type confusion trick that converts an arbitrary rw primtive to a 'pop-notepad' code execution. 
<br> Intent is to serve as a quick plug and play library to test/debug IE exploits. 

* check example.html to see how to embed this in your exploits 
* run example.html in IE 11 while attached to windbg. Once you see the alert box , break in windbg , type 
<br> `ed 1a1b3000 + 18 400`and then continue, click okay on the alert. <br>
You should see a notepad pop soon
