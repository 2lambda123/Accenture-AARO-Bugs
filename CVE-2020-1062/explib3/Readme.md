### explib3 
Gutted out outdated components of the popular [explib2](https://github.com/tombkeeper/explib2) [library](https://www.slideshare.net/xiong120/exploit-ie-using-scriptable-active-x-controls-version-english) and added a type confusion trick that converts a limited write primitive into a full blown arbitrary rw primtive and then all the way to 'pop-notepad' code execution. 
<br> Intent is to serve as a quick plug and play library to test/debug IE exploits. 

* check example.html to see how to embed this in your exploits 
* run example.html in IE 11 while attached to windbg. Once you see the alert box , break in windbg , type 
<br> `ed 1a1b3000 + 18 400`and then continue, click okay on the alert. <br>
You should see a notepad pop soon
